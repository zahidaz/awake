# AI-Assisted Malware

Large language models and generative AI are being integrated into the Android malware lifecycle at multiple stages: code generation, social engineering, biometric fraud, and evasion of ML-based detectors. The impact so far is more about lowering the skill barrier and accelerating development than creating fundamentally new capabilities, but runtime AI integration and deepfake-based biometric fraud represent genuinely novel attack vectors.

!!! warning "Distinguishing Hype from Reality"
    [Recorded Future introduced](https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/ai-malware-hype-vs-reality) the "AI Malware Maturity Model" (AIM3) to classify what truly counts as AI malware. Most current usage is LLMs as a "force multiplier" for existing workflows. [OpenAI stated](https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/influence-and-cyber-operations-an-update_October-2024.pdf) in their October 2024 threat report that "the use of ChatGPT has not led to any significant breakthroughs in malware creation." The distinction between AI-assisted and AI-native malware matters: most of what's observed is the former.

## Categories

### 1. LLM-Assisted Malware Development

Threat actors using ChatGPT, Gemini, or underground alternatives to write, debug, and refine malware code.

**STORM-0817: Iranian APT Using ChatGPT for Android Surveillanceware**

[OpenAI disclosed in October 2024](https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/influence-and-cyber-operations-an-update_October-2024.pdf) that STORM-0817, an Iran-based threat actor, used ChatGPT to debug and develop Android malware. The malware was described as "relatively rudimentary" surveillanceware targeting contacts, call logs, installed packages, screenshots, browsing history, location, and files from external storage. They developed two Android packages (`com.example.myttt` and `com.mihanwebmaster.ashpazi`) and used ChatGPT to build server-side C2 code on a WAMP stack with the domain `stickhero[.]pro`.

OpenAI assessed that ChatGPT did not provide capabilities beyond what was already publicly available. [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/openai-confirms-threat-actors-use-chatgpt-to-write-malware/) and [SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/news/openai-reveals-chatgpt-use-by-cyberav3ngers-android-malware-developers) covered the disclosure.

**HP Wolf Security: AI-Generated Malware**

[HP Wolf Security identified in September 2024](https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/hp-wolf-security-threat-insights-report-september-2024/) a campaign targeting French-speaking users with VBScript and JavaScript showing strong indicators of generative AI authorship: structured comments explaining each line, native-language variable names, and consistent formatting. The malware deployed AsyncRAT. HP characterized this as one of the first documented in-the-wild cases of AI-generated malware.

### 2. Deepfake Biometric Fraud

The most impactful AI-driven mobile attack vector to date: stealing facial biometric data and using AI face-swapping to bypass bank facial recognition.

**GoldPickaxe: Facial Biometric Theft**

[Group-IB disclosed in February 2024](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/goldfactory-ios-trojan/) that [GoldPickaxe](../malware/families/goldpickaxe.md), developed by Chinese-speaking threat group GoldFactory, steals facial biometric data on both Android and iOS to generate deepfakes for bypassing bank facial recognition.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Targets | Thailand, Vietnam banking apps |
| Disguise | Government service apps (Thai "Digital Pension" app) |
| Collection | Prompts victim to record video: blink, smile, face left/right, nod, open mouth |
| Usage | AI face-swapping services create deepfakes to log into victim's banking app |
| Confirmation | Thai police confirmed criminals using captured face scans to bypass banking facial recognition |

This represents a genuine paradigm shift: the malware itself is relatively simple (record video, exfiltrate), but the AI backend (deepfake generation) enables a novel attack that didn't previously exist.

**AI Voice Cloning in Mobile Vishing**

Voice phishing surged [442% in 2025](https://deepstrike.io/blog/vishing-statistics-2025). [Group-IB documented](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/voice-deepfake-scams/) AI voice cloning in social engineering attacks delivered over mobile calls. Modern AI speech models create realistic impersonation from seconds of target audio. Asia-Pacific saw a [194% surge in deepfake-related fraud attempts](https://deepstrike.io/blog/vishing-statistics-2025) in 2024 vs 2023. No public reports document Android malware that autonomously conducts voice cloning; the current model is attackers using separate AI tools then calling victims on their phones.

### 3. Underground Malicious LLM Tools

Custom, jailbroken, and fine-tuned models sold on underground forums for generating phishing content and malware code.

| Tool | First Seen | Base Model | Price | Status |
|------|-----------|------------|-------|--------|
| [WormGPT](https://slashnext.com/blog/wormgpt-the-generative-ai-tool-cybercriminals-are-using-to-launch-business-email-compromise-attacks/) | July 2023 | GPT-J 6B | ~60 EUR/month, $220 lifetime | Active. [New variants](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4008912/wormgpt-returns-new-malicious-ai-variants-built-on-grok-and-mixtral-uncovered.html) on Grok and Mixtral (2024-2025) |
| FraudGPT | July 2023 | Unknown | $90-200/month, $1,700/year | Sold by "CanadianKingpin12" on dark web. [LevelBlue coverage](https://www.levelblue.com/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/wormgpt-and-fraudgpt-the-rise-of-malicious-llms) |
| [KawaiiGPT](https://cyberscoop.com/malicious-llm-tools-cybercrime-wormgpt-kawaiigpt/) | July 2025 | Open-source | Free (GitHub) | [Unit 42](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/dilemma-of-ai-malicious-llms/) calls it "entry-level but effective" |

[KrebsOnSecurity profiled](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/08/meet-the-brains-behind-the-malware-friendly-ai-chat-service-wormgpt/) the WormGPT developer. The original version underperformed expectations (described as "pretty lame" by users). The real significance is the trend: commoditizing AI-assisted cybercrime tools that remove technical barriers for low-skill operators.

!!! note "DarkBERT"
    [DarkBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08596) is a legitimate academic project: a BERT-based model pre-trained on 2.2TB of Tor dark web data for cybersecurity research (classifying ransomware leak sites, detecting information leaks). Claims of malicious derivatives (DarkBART) appeared on underground forums but remain [largely unverified](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/gpt-based-malware-trains-dark-web).

### 4. Runtime AI Integration

Malware that makes LLM API calls during execution to modify its own behavior.

[Google Threat Intelligence Group cataloged](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/advances-in-threat-actor-usage-of-ai-tools-en.pdf) five malware families with runtime AI integration in their November 2025 report ([The Hacker News coverage](https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/google-uncovers-promptflux-malware-that.html)):

| Family | Mechanism | Detail |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| PROMPTFLUX | Gemini 1.5 Flash API | VBScript malware queries Gemini to rewrite its own source code hourly. "Thinking Robot" component instructs the LLM to act as an "expert VB Script obfuscator." Self-propagates via Windows Startup folder. |
| PROMPTLOCK | AI-generated payloads | Experimental ransomware using AI to generate Lua encryption payloads at runtime. Targets Windows, macOS, Linux. |
| PROMPTSTEAL | Hugging Face API | Queries Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct to generate system reconnaissance commands. Used by Russian actor APT28 in Ukraine. |
| FRUITSHELL | Hardcoded prompts | PowerShell reverse shell designed to bypass LLM-based security analysis tools. |

These are not Android-specific but represent the state of the art in AI-integrated malware. The techniques (polymorphic code rewriting via LLM, AI-generated payloads, prompt-based evasion) are transferable to mobile.

### 5. AI-Assisted Campaigns

**EvilAI Campaign** ([Trend Micro, September 2025](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/evilai.html)): Operators use AI-generated code and social engineering to disguise malware as legitimate applications (PDF editors, AI-enhanced tools). Professional interfaces with valid digital signatures. AES-encrypted C2 communication. 56 incidents in Europe, 29 in the Americas, 29 in Asia/Middle East/Africa in one week of monitoring.

**FunkSec** ([Check Point, January 2025](https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/funksec-alleged-top-ransomware-group-powered-by-ai/)): Ransomware-as-a-service with an AI-assisted Rust-based encryptor. 85+ claimed victims in its first month. Check Point assessed the codebase organization indicated AI assistance that enabled "rapid iteration despite the author's apparent lack of technical expertise."
