# NotCompatible

TCP proxy trojan discovered by Lookout in May 2012. NotCompatible turned infected Android devices into network relay nodes for spam campaigns and ticket scalping operations. Its third variant (NotCompatible.C, 2014) introduced Conficker-level sophistication with encrypted peer-to-peer C2 communication, making it the longest-running and most technically advanced mobile botnet of its era.
