# Elibomi / Drinik

India-focused spyware and banking trojan targeting Indian taxpayers and bank customers. First seen in November 2020, Elibomi evolved through multiple stages, progressing from a simple phishing tool to a full banking trojan with screen recording, keylogging, and [Accessibility Service](../../attacks/accessibility-abuse.md) abuse. CERT-In issued an advisory in September 2021 warning about Drinik (an evolved variant name) targeting customers of 27 banks.
