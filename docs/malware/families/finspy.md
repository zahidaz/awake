# FinSpy

FinSpy (also sold as FinFisher) was a commercial surveillance suite developed by Munich-based FinFisher GmbH and marketed to law enforcement and intelligence agencies worldwide. Active from approximately 2012 through 2022, it stood out for its extraordinary obfuscation: multiple protection layers, a custom virtual machine, anti-analysis checks, and ISP-level delivery mechanisms. The company collapsed in 2022 after German prosecutors investigated the unauthorized export of surveillance software to Turkey. FinSpy's obfuscation complexity became a benchmark in the malware analysis community, with researchers from ESET, Kaspersky, and Amnesty International investing months to produce public analyses.

## Origin and Lineage

FinFisher GmbH operated as a subsidiary of Gamma Group International, a UK-based company. The product line included desktop and mobile implants marketed at trade shows like ISS World (the "Wiretappers' Ball") alongside a full suite of network injection tools for ISP-level deployment.

[Citizen Lab first documented FinFisher's mobile capabilities in August 2012](https://citizenlab.ca/2012/08/the-smartphone-who-loved-me-finfisher-goes-mobile/) in their report "The SmartPhone Who Loved Me," identifying FinSpy samples for Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and Symbian. A 2014 breach of Gamma Group's servers by the hacktivist "Phineas Fisher" leaked 40GB of internal data, including FinFisher source code, client lists, and pricing documents. The leak confirmed sales to governments with poor human rights records including Bahrain, Ethiopia, and Turkmenistan.

[Citizen Lab mapped FinFisher's proliferation across dozens of countries](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/10/mapping-finfishers-continuing-proliferation/) in their 2015 report "Pay No Attention to the Server Behind the Proxy," identifying C2 servers in more countries than any previous scan despite the 2014 leak.

In 2022, [FinFisher GmbH filed for insolvency](https://www.ecchr.eu/en/case/surveillance-software-germany-turkey-finfisher/) and was dissolved following a criminal investigation by the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office. The investigation, triggered by a criminal complaint from GFF, Reporters Without Borders, netzpolitik.org, and ECCHR, focused on the [unauthorized export of surveillance software to Turkey](https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2022/etappensieg-finfisher-ist-pleite). In May 2023, [German prosecutors charged four former executives](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/german-prosecutors-indict-finfisher-spyware-executives-a-22174) of the corporate group.

## Distribution

FinFisher used multiple delivery mechanisms, with ISP-level injection being the most distinctive.

| Vector | Details |
|--------|---------|
| ISP-level man-in-the-middle | Network injection appliances deployed at ISPs intercept download requests and replace legitimate software with trojanized versions. [ESET documented this in 2017](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/new-finfisher-surveillance-campaigns/), identifying ISP-level MITM in Turkey (Turk Telekom) and Egypt where downloads of legitimate software (Avast, CCleaner, Opera, 7-Zip, WinRAR) were silently replaced with FinSpy-bundled installers. |
| Spear-phishing | Emails with malicious attachments or links tailored to specific targets |
| Physical access | Direct installation when agents have physical possession of the device |
| Trojanized apps | APKs disguised as legitimate applications distributed through links or alternative app stores |

The ISP-level injection is particularly relevant because it requires cooperation (willing or coerced) from the target's internet service provider, meaning the deploying government has domestic authority over telecommunications infrastructure.

## Capabilities

### Android Implant

The Android variant provides comprehensive surveillance. [Kaspersky documented updated iOS and Android implants in July 2019](https://securelist.com/new-finspy-ios-and-android-implants-revealed-itw/91685/), noting activity in nearly 20 countries:

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Call recording | Record voice calls, VoIP calls (Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, etc.) |
| Messaging | Intercept SMS, MMS, and messages from Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, Threema, Facebook Messenger |
| Camera | Silent activation of front and rear cameras for photo and video |
| Microphone | Ambient audio recording, room monitoring |
| Location | GPS tracking, cell tower positioning |
| Keylogging | Capture keystrokes across all applications via accessibility |
| Contacts and calendar | Full exfiltration |
| File access | Browse and exfiltrate device storage |
| Screen capture | Periodic screenshots |
| Root exploitation | Abuse known vulnerabilities to gain root privileges |

### Desktop Variants

While this wiki focuses on Android, FinSpy's desktop capabilities are worth noting for context: [Kaspersky's 2021 analysis revealed a UEFI bootkit](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/) that infects the Windows Boot Manager for persistence below the OS level, and [Amnesty International documented Linux and macOS variants](https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/finspy-malware-macos-linux.html) targeting Egyptian civil society organizations.

## Technical Details

### Obfuscation: The Defining Feature

FinSpy's obfuscation is what separates it from every other commercial spyware family. Multiple research teams have documented its layered protection:

**Four-layer obfuscation system** ([Kaspersky, 2021](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/)):

| Layer | Technique |
|-------|-----------|
| Layer 1 | FinSpy Mutator: instruction-level code transformation |
| Layer 2 | OLLVM-style obfuscation: control flow flattening, bogus control flow, instruction substitution |
| Layer 3 | Custom virtual machine: bytecode interpreter that executes protected functions in a proprietary VM ISA |
| Layer 4 | Anti-analysis shellcodes: environment fingerprinting that terminates execution in sandboxes and VMs |

**Custom Virtual Machine** ([ESET, January 2018](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/01/23/guide-makes-possible-peek-finfisher/)):

ESET researcher Filip Kafka published ["ESET's guide to deobfuscating and devirtualizing FinFisher"](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WP-FinFisher.pdf), the definitive public reference for analyzing FinFisher's VM. The VM translates native x86 instructions into custom bytecode at build time. At runtime, a bytecode interpreter executes these instructions, meaning static analysis tools like IDA Pro see only the interpreter loop rather than the actual logic. ESET also [released IDA Python scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/eset/malware-research/blob/master/finfisher/ida_finfisher_vm.py) to assist with devirtualization.

### Android-Specific Obfuscation

The Android variant uses its own protection scheme. [Defensive Lab Agency analyzed FinSpy for Android](https://defensive-lab.agency/blog/2020/09/finspy-android/) (designated DexDen in their analysis), finding:

- Configuration data encrypted and hidden within the APK
- Heavy use of JNI (Java Native Interface) calls to move logic into native code where Dalvik-level analysis tools cannot follow
- Anti-emulator checks targeting common analysis environments
- String encryption with runtime decryption

### Persistence

On Android, FinSpy registers as a device administrator and uses accessibility services to prevent removal. On rooted devices, it installs system-level components. The desktop variant achieves persistence through a UEFI bootkit ([Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/)) that operates below the operating system, surviving OS reinstallation.

### C2 Communication

FinSpy communicates with its C2 over HTTPS with custom encryption. Citizen Lab's scanning research identified that FinFisher uses anonymizing proxy servers to obscure the true location of master C2 servers, though [their 2015 research devised techniques to unmask these proxies](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/10/mapping-finfishers-continuing-proliferation/).

## Known Deployments and Targets

[Citizen Lab's cumulative research](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/10/mapping-finfishers-continuing-proliferation/) identified FinFisher deployments or suspected use in over 30 countries:

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| Middle East & North Africa | Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | Angola, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa |
| Europe | Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain |
| Asia | Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, Vietnam |
| Americas | Mexico, Paraguay, Venezuela |

Confirmed targets include Bahraini activists and dissidents, Ethiopian opposition journalists, Turkish political targets (the export that triggered the criminal investigation), and Egyptian civil society organizations.
