# SlemBunk

Banking overlay trojan discovered by FireEye in December 2015. SlemBunk targeted 33 financial applications across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific using a sophisticated multi-stage attack chain that required three separate malicious app downloads before delivering the final payload. FireEye identified 170 samples with progressive code obfuscation.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **First Seen** | Late 2015 |
| **Type** | Banking trojan (overlay-based) |
| **Attribution** | Unknown |
| **Aliases** | Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Slembunk (Kaspersky) |

## Distribution

Distributed via malicious and adult websites, disguised as Adobe Flash Player and other legitimate apps. Used a multi-stage attack chain:

1. Victim downloads initial dropper app
2. Dropper fetches second-stage payload
3. Second stage delivers final banking trojan

The C2 admin interface allowed attackers to customize payload delivery per campaign.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Overlay attacks | Customized phishing overlays for 33 financial apps |
| Process monitoring | Detected targeted apps in the foreground |
| C2 management | Admin panel for overlay template and payload customization |
| Obfuscation | Progressive code obfuscation across variants |

## Target Regions

SlemBunk targeted banks across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The multi-stage delivery chain and well-organized C2 infrastructure (multiple domains registered throughout 2015) suggested a professional operation.

## Related Families

SlemBunk was part of the wave of banking trojans influenced by the [GM Bot](gmbot.md) overlay model. Its multi-stage delivery chain was an innovation that later became standard practice for banking trojan campaigns via [Play Store droppers](../../attacks/play-store-evasion.md).
