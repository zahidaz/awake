# SLocker

One of the oldest and most prolific Android ransomware families. Active since 2014 with 600+ variants, SLocker combined screen-locking with file encryption and was among the first Android malware to use Tor for C2 communication. Its source code was decompiled and published in July 2017, causing a surge in variants including one that mimicked WannaCry's UI. Closely related to [Simplocker](simplocker.md).

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **First Seen** | 2014 |
| **Type** | Ransomware (screen locker + file encryptor) |
| **Attribution** | Multiple independent operators (source code public) |
| **Aliases** | SimpleLocker, SMSLocker, Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Small (Kaspersky), Android/Ransom.SLocker (Malwarebytes) |

## Distribution

Counterfeit apps on Google Play and third-party stores. Posed as multimedia players, game guides, and popular software. Also spread through fake update prompts and social engineering.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| File encryption | AES encryption of images, documents, videos |
| Screen lock | Full-screen ransom overlay, some variants changed device PIN |
| Tor C2 | Among the first Android malware to use Tor for C2 |
| Scareware | Early variants impersonated FBI/police using law enforcement branding |
| Camera access | Later variants could access camera |
| Device admin | Hijacked Device Administrator for persistence |

## Scale

- 400+ variants by 2016, surging to 600+ over six months
- Estimated $10 million in ransom payments
- NHS England issued a cyber alert about SLocker
- WannaCry-mimicking variant appeared July 2017

## Source Code Leak

The source code was decompiled and published online in July 2017, leading to a variant explosion. This mirrors the pattern seen with [BankBot](bankbot.md), [GM Bot](gmbot.md), and [Cerberus](cerberus.md) where source availability dramatically lowers the entry barrier.
