# Thamera

Android trojan notable for being written in .NET Framework using the cross-platform .NET MAUI framework, which is highly unusual for Android malware and complicates traditional static analysis tools designed for Java/Kotlin bytecode. Tracked by Kaspersky in Q3 2023, Thamera turns target devices into proxies for creating accounts on social networks.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **First Seen** | 2023 |
| **Type** | Trojan (proxy / social media account farming) |
| **Attribution** | Unknown |
| **Aliases** | Trojan.AndroidOS.Thamera (Kaspersky), Trojan:AndroidOS/Thamera.A!MTB (Microsoft) |

## Distribution

Unknown specific vector. Concentrated in India per Kaspersky Q3 2023 statistics.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Proxy creation | Turns devices into proxies for social network account creation |
| .NET MAUI framework | Written in .NET, defeating standard Android decompilers (jadx, apktool) |
| Account farming | Automated social media account creation through proxied connections |

## Significance

Thamera's use of .NET MAUI is its most interesting aspect from a reversing perspective. Standard Android analysis tools expect Dalvik bytecode or native ARM code. .NET MAUI apps package their logic in .NET assemblies that require different tooling (ILSpy, dnSpy) for analysis. [McAfee documented](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-android-malware-campaigns-evading-detection-using-cross-platform-framework-net-maui/) broader adoption of .NET MAUI by Android malware campaigns specifically to evade detection.
