# FakePlayer

The first known Android malware. Discovered by Kaspersky in August 2010, FakePlayer was a simple SMS trojan disguised as a media player that sent premium-rate SMS messages without user knowledge. It proved Android was a viable target for mobile malware authors who had previously focused on Symbian and Windows Mobile.

## Overview

| Property | Value |

| **Aliases** | Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakePlayer.a (Kaspersky), Android.SmsSend.1 (Dr.Web), TROJ_DROIDSMS.A (Trend Micro) |

## Distribution

Distributed as a 13 KB APK file disguised as a media player application via websites targeting Russian-speaking users. Not distributed through the Android Market.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Premium SMS | Sent messages to premium-rate numbers 8353 and 3353 |
| Social engineering | Displayed a media player icon to appear legitimate |

FakePlayer had no C2 communication, no data exfiltration, no root exploits. It was functionally a single-purpose SMS fraud tool.

|------------|---------|
| [SEND_SMS](../../permissions/sms/send-sms.md) | Send premium-rate SMS messages |

## Evolution

At least three variants were identified (FakePlayer.a, .b, .c). The premium SMS fraud model it pioneered became the dominant Android malware monetization strategy throughout 2010-2012, before [overlay attacks](../../attacks/overlay-attacks.md) shifted the landscape toward credential theft.
