# Koler

Police-themed screen-lock ransomware discovered in 2014. Koler displayed geo-targeted fake law enforcement warnings on infected devices, demanding ransom. Distributed through a network of pornographic website redirects, it was connected to the Reveton ransomware operation that had previously targeted Windows users. The campaign reached nearly 200,000 victims, 80% in the United States.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **First Seen** | April 2014 |
| **Type** | Screen-lock ransomware ("police locker") |
| **Attribution** | Connected to Reveton ransomware network |
| **Aliases** | Trojan.AndroidOS.Koler (Kaspersky), Trojan:Android/Koler (F-Secure) |

## Distribution

Distributed via a network of pornographic website redirects. Victims visiting adult sites were redirected through dozens of automatically generated domains to a central hub serving the malicious APK (`animalporn.apk`). Required manual download and installation.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Screen lock | Full-screen browser window blocking device interaction |
| Geo-targeting | Customized lock screens impersonating local law enforcement based on victim's country |
| Scareware | Fake police warning claiming illegal activity detected |
| Data exfiltration | Collected IMEI and sent to C2 |
| Ransom demand | $100-$300 |

Koler did NOT encrypt files despite claiming to have done so. It was purely a screen locker using social engineering.

## Geographic Distribution

| Country | Visitors | Percentage |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| United States | 146,650 | ~80% |
| United Kingdom | 13,692 | ~7% |
| Australia | 6,223 | ~3% |
| Canada | 5,573 | ~3% |

The campaign was disrupted on July 23, 2014, when the C2 server began sending "Uninstall" commands to victims.

## Significance

Koler demonstrated that the "police locker" social engineering model worked on mobile. The porn-themed distribution network combined with fake law enforcement warnings exploited victims' reluctance to report the crime. The cross-platform campaign infrastructure (mobile malware + Angler Exploit Kit + browser ransomware) represented an early example of unified cross-platform operations.
