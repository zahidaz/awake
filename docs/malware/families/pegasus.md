# Pegasus

Pegasus is the most well-documented mobile surveillance tool ever deployed. Developed by Israel's [NSO Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSO_Group), it provides operators with complete device compromise through zero-click exploit chains that require no interaction from the target. Sold exclusively to government clients under the label of "lawful intercept," Pegasus has been found on the devices of journalists, human rights defenders, opposition politicians, and heads of state across dozens of countries. Its Android variant, internally called Chrysaor by Google, mirrors most iOS capabilities while adapting to the Android security model.

## Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| First Seen | August 2016 (public discovery) |
| Status | Active, continuously updated |
| Type | Commercial spyware (government-exclusive) |
| Attribution | NSO Group Technologies (Herzliya, Israel) |
| Aliases | Chrysaor (Google/Android), Trident (iOS exploit chain, 2016), Q Suite (marketing name) |
| Platforms | iOS, Android |

## Origin and Lineage

NSO Group was founded in 2010 by Niv Carmi, Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie, all with backgrounds in Israeli intelligence. The company operates under the claim that it sells only to vetted government agencies for counter-terrorism and law enforcement. Pegasus is the flagship product, though NSO also markets other tools under different names.

The first public evidence of Pegasus emerged in August 2016 when UAE human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor received SMS messages containing exploit links. Rather than clicking, Mansoor forwarded them to [Citizen Lab researchers, who published "The Million Dollar Dissident"](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/) in collaboration with Lookout Security. The analysis revealed a chain of three iOS zero-days (dubbed Trident) capable of remotely jailbreaking a stock iPhone 6.

[Lookout subsequently published a technical analysis of the Android variant](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/lookout-pegasus-android-technical-analysis.pdf) in April 2017, designating it Chrysaor. The Android version does not rely on zero-days for rooting: it uses the [Framaroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framaroot) technique, a well-known set of Android root exploits. If rooting fails, it requests accessibility permissions to achieve data exfiltration through above-board APIs.

## Distribution

Pegasus delivery has evolved significantly over its lifetime, moving from one-click social engineering to fully remote zero-click exploitation.

| Era | Delivery Method | Exploit Chain |
|-----|----------------|---------------|
| 2016 | SMS with exploit link | Trident: CVE-2016-4655 (KASLR bypass), CVE-2016-4656 (kernel exploit), CVE-2016-4657 (WebKit RCE) |
| 2017-2018 | Spear-phishing links via SMS, WhatsApp | Various browser and kernel chains |
| 2019 | [WhatsApp zero-day voice call](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/13/whatsapp-urges-update-after-vulnerability-utilised-by-spyware) | CVE-2019-3568: buffer overflow in WhatsApp VOIP stack, no answer required |
| 2020 | Zero-click iMessage | KISMET: exploited iMessage on iOS 13.5.1-13.7, [discovered targeting Al Jazeera journalists](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/) |
| 2021 | Zero-click iMessage | [FORCEDENTRY](https://citizenlab.ca/research/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/): CVE-2021-30860, JBIG2 integer overflow in CoreGraphics PDF parser, bypassed BlastDoor sandbox |
| 2022 | Zero-click iMessage | [Three new chains](https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/) exploiting iOS 15 and iOS 16, including PWNYOURHOME and FINDMYPWN |

On Android, delivery typically involves a one-click link that downloads the implant APK. The operator sends a crafted SMS or message through any app. When the target taps the link, the browser redirects through an exploit server that either exploits a browser vulnerability or simply serves the APK with social engineering to encourage installation.

For ISP-level deployment (documented in several countries), operators with access to network infrastructure can inject redirects into unencrypted HTTP traffic, pushing the malicious download without the need for phishing messages.

## Capabilities

Once installed, Pegasus provides total device access. The implant operates as a persistent rootkit with the following capabilities:

### Data Collection

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Messages | SMS, MMS, iMessage, email (before and after encryption in E2E apps) |
| Messaging apps | WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger, Viber, Skype (reads from local databases) |
| Calls | Live call recording and call log extraction |
| Camera | Silent activation of front and rear cameras |
| Microphone | Ambient audio recording, room tap functionality |
| Location | GPS, cell tower, Wi-Fi-based positioning with historical tracking |
| Passwords | Keychain/keystore extraction, stored Wi-Fi credentials |
| Contacts | Full address book exfiltration |
| Calendar | Calendar events and meeting details |
| Files | Browse and exfiltrate arbitrary files from device storage |
| Browser | History, bookmarks, saved passwords |

### Android-Specific Behavior (Chrysaor)

The Android implant documented by [Lookout](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/lookout-pegasus-android-technical-analysis.pdf) and [Cyber Geeks](https://cybergeeks.tech/a-technical-analysis-of-pegasus-for-android-part-1/) uses a layered approach:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Framaroot exploits | Root the device using known kernel exploits (named after Lord of the Rings characters) |
| Fallback mode | If root fails, request accessibility and usage access permissions to exfiltrate data through Android APIs |
| Self-destruct | Remove itself if it detects it cannot operate covertly, if it has not contacted C2 within 60 days, or if it detects analysis |
| Screenshot capture | Framebuffer reading (rooted) or MediaProjection (non-rooted) |
| Live audio | Record calls and ambient audio via native audio APIs |

## Technical Details

### C2 Infrastructure

Pegasus uses an anonymizing relay network for command and control. [Citizen Lab mapped C2 infrastructure across 45 countries](https://citizenlab.ca/research/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/) by fingerprinting the distinctive TLS certificates and HTTP responses of Pegasus installation servers. The C2 architecture routes through multiple proxy layers, making attribution to the operating government technically difficult but not impossible through DNS and infrastructure analysis.

Exfiltrated data is transmitted over HTTPS, encrypted with unique per-device keys. The implant polls C2 for tasking commands and uploads collected data on a schedule or on-demand.

### Persistence

On rooted Android devices, Pegasus installs itself in system partitions and survives factory resets. On non-rooted devices, it leverages device administrator privileges and accessibility services to maintain presence, reinstalling itself if the user attempts removal.

### FORCEDENTRY: The Benchmark Exploit

[Google Project Zero published a detailed technical analysis](https://projectzero.google/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html) of FORCEDENTRY, calling it "one of the most technically sophisticated exploits we've ever seen." The exploit chain:

1. Sends a PDF file disguised as a GIF through iMessage
2. Triggers an integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder within Apple's CoreGraphics
3. Constructs a small CPU architecture from JBIG2 logical operations, building a Turing-complete virtual machine from a decompression codec
4. Escapes the BlastDoor iMessage sandbox introduced in iOS 14
5. Achieves kernel code execution and installs the Pegasus implant

This demonstrated a level of exploit engineering previously assumed to be exclusive to top-tier nation-state programs.

## Known Deployments and Targets

[Citizen Lab identified suspected Pegasus operators in 45 countries](https://citizenlab.ca/research/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/) as of 2018. The [Pegasus Project investigation in 2021](https://forbiddenstories.org/about-the-pegasus-project/), coordinated by Forbidden Stories with technical support from Amnesty International's Security Lab, revealed a leaked list of over 50,000 phone numbers selected as potential targets by NSO clients.
