# Ztorg

Rooting trojan that was uploaded to Google Play almost 100 times across different apps, including "Privacy Lock" which reached 1M+ installs. Extensively documented by Kaspersky/Securelist in 2016-2017, Ztorg used modular architecture with updatable root exploit packs and monetized through WAP billing clickjacking. Later variants added SMS trojan capabilities. Connected to the broader [Triada](triada.md) ecosystem.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |

| Modular root exploits | Updatable root exploit packs for gaining system-level access |
| Post-root persistence | Survived factory resets via /system installation |
| Ad fraud | Clickjacking on WAP billing pages to steal from mobile accounts |
| App management | Delete or download apps on C2 command |
| SMS trojan | 2017 variant: send premium-rate SMS, delete incoming SMS |
| Modular architecture | Downloaded and updated functional modules from C2 |

## Monetization

Ztorg primarily monetized through clickjacking attacks on web pages with WAP billing. After rooting the device and gaining system-level access, it could silently interact with WAP billing pages to subscribe victims to premium services without their knowledge.
