# Arsink

RAT/spyware distributed through social engineering on Telegram and Discord channels. Discovered by Zimperium in late 2025, Arsink impersonated 50+ popular brands (WhatsApp, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Google) as "premium" or "mod" versions. Notable for using legitimate Google cloud infrastructure (Firebase RTDB, Storage, Apps Script, Drive) as C2 to evade network-level detection. 1,216 unique samples identified across 143 countries with ~45,000 victim IPs.
