# Keenadu

Firmware-level backdoor discovered by Kaspersky in February 2026. Keenadu compromises `libandroid_runtime.so`, a core Android system library, allowing it to operate within the context of every app on the device. Pre-installed in device firmware through supply chain compromise, it is impossible to remove using standard Android tools. Shares C2 infrastructure and payload code with BADBOX and Vo1d botnets.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **First Seen** | February 2026 |
| **Type** | Firmware-level backdoor / Supply chain compromise |
| **Attribution** | Unknown (linked to BADBOX and Vo1d botnet infrastructure) |
| **Aliases** | Connected to [Triada](triada.md), BADBOX, Vo1d ecosystems |

## Distribution

Pre-installed in device firmware during the manufacturing/supply chain process. Also found in smart home camera apps on Google Play (300,000+ downloads). Primarily affects tablets from multiple manufacturers.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| System library compromise | Modifies `libandroid_runtime.so` to operate within all app contexts |
| Full device control | Unlimited remote control via backdoor |
| Modular architecture | Browser search hijacking, app install monetization, stealthy ad interaction |
| Self-protection | Cannot be removed using standard Android OS tools |
| App infection | Can infect every installed app on the device |
| Permission escalation | Grants itself any available permissions |
| APK installation | Installs arbitrary APKs |

## Target Regions

| Country | Confirmed Infections |
|---------|---------------------|
| Russia | Primary |
| Japan | Significant |
| Germany | Significant |
| Brazil | Significant |
| Netherlands | Significant |
| **Total** | **13,715+** |

## Significance

Keenadu demonstrates the continued threat of supply chain compromise in the Android ecosystem, connecting to the broader problem documented with [Triada](triada.md) (found pre-installed in firmware since 2016) and BADBOX/Vo1d botnets. The deep firmware integration makes traditional mobile security tools ineffective for detection and removal.
