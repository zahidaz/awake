# HummingBad

Massive ad fraud rootkit operated by the Chinese advertising company Yingmob. Discovered by Check Point in February 2016, HummingBad infected 10 million devices, installed 50,000+ fraudulent apps per day, displayed 20 million malicious ads daily, and generated $300,000+/month in revenue. Check Point traced the operation to a 25-person team within Yingmob called "Development Team for Overseas Platform."

## Evolution

HummingWhale (January 2017) was a significantly evolved variant found in 20+ Google Play apps using a `com.XXXXXXX.camera` naming convention. It ran malicious apps in a virtual machine without installing them on the device, making it stealthier. Yingmob was also linked to the YiSpecter iOS malware.

## Naming Controversy

Lookout claimed HummingBad is the same family as [Shedun](shedun.md)/GhostPush/ShiftyBug. Check Point and ElevenPaths argued they are distinct families. The overlap comes from shared rooting techniques and the Yingmob actor group.
