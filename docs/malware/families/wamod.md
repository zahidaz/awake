# Malicious WhatsApp Mods

A recurring attack vector where modified WhatsApp clients (FMWhatsApp, YoWhatsApp, CanesSpy) are trojanized with malware payloads, primarily the [Triada](triada.md) trojan. These mods offer features unavailable in official WhatsApp (custom themes, read receipt hiding, message scheduling) but bundle malicious ad modules that download additional malware, steal WhatsApp authentication keys, and subscribe victims to premium services.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **First Seen** | Ongoing (documented campaigns 2021-2023) |
| **Type** | Trojanized messaging app modifications |
| **Attribution** | Various (mod developers compromised by or colluding with malware operators) |

## Major Campaigns

### FMWhatsApp (2021)

Version 16.80.0 contained a third-party ad module that included [Triada](triada.md) (`Trojan.AndroidOS.Triada.ef`). Downloaded additional malware: display ads, subscribe to paid services, intercept SMS. [Documented by Securelist](https://securelist.com/triada-trojan-in-whatsapp-mod/103679/).

### YoWhatsApp (2022)

Version 2.22.11.75 contained [Triada](triada.md) (`Trojan.AndroidOS.Triada.eq`). Distributed through ads in Snaptube and Vidmate's internal app store. Stole WhatsApp authentication keys to hijack accounts. Malicious module removed after Kaspersky contacted the developers (November 2022).

### CanesSpy (2023)

WhatsApp spy mod proliferating within Telegram channels. 340,000+ attacks in October 2023 alone. Targeted Arabic and Azeri-speaking users. Kaspersky detection: `Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.CanesSpy`. [Documented by Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/whatsapp-mods-canesspy/49656/).

## Common Pattern

All three campaigns follow the same pattern:

1. Popular WhatsApp mod attracts large user base with extra features
2. Malicious ad SDK or spy module is injected into a mod update
3. Users install the update through third-party sources (no Play Store review)
4. Malware component activates: data theft, subscription fraud, or account hijacking
