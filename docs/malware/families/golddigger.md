# GoldDigger / GoldFactory

A suite of Android (and iOS) banking trojans operated by a Chinese-speaking threat actor group dubbed "GoldFactory" by Group-IB. The cluster includes GoldDigger, GoldDiggerPlus, GoldKefu, and [GoldPickaxe](goldpickaxe.md). GoldPickaxe is the first mobile trojan observed stealing facial biometric data to create deepfakes for bypassing bank face-verification systems.
