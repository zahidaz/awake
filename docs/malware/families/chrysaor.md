# Chrysaor

The Android version of NSO Group's [Pegasus](pegasus.md) spyware. Discovered by Lookout and Google in April 2017 as the Android counterpart to the iOS Pegasus found on Ahmed Mansoor's phone in August 2016. Named after Pegasus's brother in Greek mythology. Unlike iOS Pegasus which used zero-click exploits, Chrysaor used the Framaroot framework for rooting and could persist across factory resets by installing to the /system partition.

## Overview
