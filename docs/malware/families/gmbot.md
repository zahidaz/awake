# GM Bot

The malware that pioneered [overlay attacks](../../attacks/overlay-attacks.md) on Android. Created by a Russian-speaking developer known as "GanJaman" and sold on darknet forums from 2014, GM Bot introduced the technique of displaying fake login screens over legitimate banking apps. Its source code leak in early 2016 spawned an entire ecosystem of derivative banking trojans, including [BankBot](bankbot.md), Mazar BOT, and [SlemBunk](slembunk.md).

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **First Seen** | October 2014 |
| **Type** | Banking trojan (overlay-based) |
| **Attribution** | "GanJaman" (Russian underground forums) |
| **Aliases** | Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.GMBot (Kaspersky), Android.Bankosy (Symantec), Acecard, MazarBOT (derivatives) |

## Distribution

Sold on Russian underground forums. Distributed to victims through phishing and repackaged apps. Over 200,000 infections from GM Bot-based trojans within a three-month period ([Avast](https://blog.avast.com/android-trojan-gm-bot-is-evolving-and-targeting-more-than-50-banks-worldwide)).

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| [Overlay attacks](../../attacks/overlay-attacks.md) | Displayed fake login screens over 50+ banking apps |
| SMS interception | Bypassed 2FA by intercepting incoming SMS |
| Device admin | Requested admin privileges for persistence |
| Screen lock | Could lock the device screen |
| Customizable overlays | Phishing templates matched targeted banking apps |

## Source Code Leak

In December 2015/February 2016, a disgruntled customer of GanJaman leaked the GM Bot v1 source code. This leak had a cascading effect on the Android threat landscape:

| Derivative | Period | Relationship |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| [BankBot](bankbot.md) | 2016-2018 | Open-source banking trojan evolved from GM Bot concepts |
| Mazar BOT | 2016 | Used GM Bot code with added Tor communication |
| [SlemBunk](slembunk.md) | 2015-2016 | Influenced by GM Bot overlay model |
| Acecard | 2015-2016 | Adopted GM Bot's overlay technique for 30+ banks |

GanJaman released GM Bot v2 in March 2016 after the leak, but it gained limited traction due to damaged reputation.

## Significance

GM Bot's overlay attack model became the standard approach for all subsequent Android banking trojans. Every major family from [Anubis](anubis.md) to [TsarBot](tsarbot.md) uses variations of the technique GM Bot introduced.
