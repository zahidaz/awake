# Malware Families

Individual write-ups on notable Android malware families. Each entry documents origin, capabilities, distribution, target regions, C2 infrastructure, and links to primary research from the teams who analyzed them.

Families are grouped by primary function. Many overlap categories (a banking trojan may also be spyware). The primary classification reflects their main operational purpose. For how different vendors name the same family, see [Naming Conventions](../naming-conventions.md). For chronological evolution, see [Timeline](../timeline.md).

## Lineage Map

Several families share code lineage. Understanding these relationships is critical for attribution and capability prediction.
