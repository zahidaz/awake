# Exobot

Major MaaS banking trojan that operated from 2016 to 2018, when its author put the source code up for sale. Based on the [Marcher](marcher.md) trojan, Exobot was one of the most commercially successful Android banking trojans of its era. Its source code leak in May 2018 spawned the ExobotCompact/Coper lineage that eventually became [Octo](octo.md), one of the most active banking trojans of 2022-2025.
