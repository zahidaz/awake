# App Distribution

Alternative distribution channels outside Google Play and the APK modding ecosystem. Relevant because malware distribution increasingly uses third-party stores and sideloading.

## Third-Party Stores

| Store/Platform | Region | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| 360 Mobile Assistant | China | Qihoo 360's store. |
| Amazon Appstore | Global | Ships with Fire devices. Available on standard Android. |
| APKMirror | Global | APK hosting. More curated than APKPure. Focused on original developer uploads. |
| Apkada | Russia/CIS | Russian-language store. |
| APKPure | Global | APK download site. Users sideload from here. Itself was compromised with malware in 2021. |
| Aptoide | Global | Third-party marketplace. Community-driven. Used by legitimate apps and malware alike. |
| Baidu Mobile Assistant | China | Baidu's app store. |
| CafeBazaar | Iran | Dominant Iranian Android store. 40M+ users. |
| Google Play | Global | Official store. Play Protect scanning. Droppers still get through regularly. |
| Huawei AppGallery | Global (Huawei devices) | Second-largest Android store. Own review process. Used for regional malware distribution. |
| OPPO App Market | China/Global | Pre-installed on OPPO/OnePlus. |
| Samsung Galaxy Store | Global (Samsung devices) | Samsung's store. Less strict review than Play Store historically. |
| Tencent MyApp (Yingyongbao) | China | Major Chinese Android store. |
| Vivo App Store | China/Global | Pre-installed on Vivo devices. |
| Xiaomi GetApps | China/Global | Pre-installed on Xiaomi devices. |

In China, Google Play is unavailable. Users install apps from OEM stores (Tencent, Baidu, Xiaomi, etc.), making these stores primary distribution channels for both legitimate apps and malware targeting Chinese users.

## APK Modding & Cracking

Modified APKs (mods) distributed through forums and dedicated sites. Modded APKs are a malware distribution vector: trojans are injected into popular cracked apps.

| Platform | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| ACMarket | Modded app store | Distributes modified APKs. Known malware distribution vector. |
| An1.com | Modded games | Modded Android game distribution. |
| HappyMod | Modded app store | Modded game APKs. Community uploads. |
| Lucky Patcher | Modification tool | In-app purchase bypass, ad removal, permission modification. Widely used. |
| Mobilism | Forum + APK sharing | Cracked/modded APK distribution. Active community. |

Modded APKs are frequently repackaged with additional payloads (adware, spyware, banking trojans). The user installs a "cracked" version of a game or premium app and gets malware bundled in.
