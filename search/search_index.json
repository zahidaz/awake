ThreatFabric named it Anatsa, other researchers called it TeaBot. Alien Cerberus v2 Distinct fork. Built on Cerberus code but with significant additions. Not merely a version update. Ermac Cerberus v3 Distinct fork by DukeEugene. Shares Cerberus DNA but different operator and added features. Hook Ermac v3 Evolution. DukeEugene marketed it as new, but ThreatFabric proved it contains all Ermac code plus new commands. Octo ExobotCompact, Coper Same lineage. Exobot (2016) -&gt; ExobotCompact (2021) -&gt; Coper -&gt; Octo (2022) -&gt; Octo2 (2024). Hydra BianLian Distinct families. Hydra was initially tracked alongside a dropper called BianLian (not the ransomware group). Medusa TangleBot Same family. ThreatFabric named it Medusa, Proofpoint called it TangleBot. BRATA AmexTroll Same lineage. BRATA rebranded/evolved, AmexTroll is a later variant. Copybara BRATA v3 Related but distinct. Evolved from BRATA codebase, but Cleafy tracked it as separate. Cabassous FluBot Same family. Kaspersky's detection name (Cabassous) vs common research name (FluBot). Cebruser Cerberus Same family. Kaspersky detection name is \"Cebruser\" instead of \"Cerberus\". Piom Hydra Same family. Kaspersky's detection name for Hydra samples. Wroba MoqHao Same family. Kaspersky uses \"Wroba,\" McAfee uses \"MoqHao,\" campaign tracked as \"Roaming Mantis.\" XLoader MoqHao Same family. Some vendors use XLoader for MoqHao/Wroba variants. Frogblight Coper variant? Possible relationship. Kaspersky notes possible connection to Coper/Octo lineage. GoldPickaxe GoldDigger Related but distinct. GoldFactory group operates GoldDigger, GoldPickaxe (Android + iOS), and Gigabud. GoldPickaxe adds facial biometric theft. Gigabud GoldDigger, Gigaflower Same GoldFactory group. Shares code (<code>libstrategy.so</code>) and Virbox packer with GoldDigger. Gigaflower is a pre-release successor. LightSpy DragonEgg, WyrmSpy DragonEgg is Lookout's name for the Android variant. ThreatFabric linked it to LightSpy iOS. WyrmSpy may be a related successor. BoneSpy Gamaredon mobile Initially attributed to Gamaredon (FSB), reattributed to Sandcat (Uzbekistan SSS). BingoMod BRATA variant? Behavioral similarity (post-fraud device wipe) but independent codebase per Cleafy analysis. NGate NFCGate NGate uses the NFCGate academic tool for NFC relay. NFCGate itself is a legitimate security research tool. TrickMo TrickBot mobile Originally a companion to TrickBot desktop trojan. The 2024 resurgence operates independently with no TrickBot dependency. Antidot AppLite AppLite is an Antidot variant (Zimperium naming) targeting corporate employees.
