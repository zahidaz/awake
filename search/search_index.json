Permissions are categorized into different protection levels, with dangerous permissions being those that could potentially affect user privacy or device operation.</p> <p>Dangerous permissions are runtime permissions that must be explicitly granted by the user. However, these permissions are frequently abused by malicious applications and are common targets for exploitation.</p>"},{"location":"permissions/#permission-model","title":"Permission Model","text":"<p>Starting from Android 6.0 (API level 23), dangerous permissions must be requested at runtime rather than being granted at install time.
